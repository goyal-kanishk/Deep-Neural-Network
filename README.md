# Deep-Neural-Network
This repository includes the implementation a basic multi-layered neural network.
The jupyter notebook implements the NN using several helper functions written in the dnn_utils_v3.py.
The dataset folder has two files one for the training set and other for the test set.
This model is fairly simple and does not use any regularisation techniques.
This model is from the course 1 of deep learning speciliazation on cousera.
